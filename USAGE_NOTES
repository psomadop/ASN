ASN1C notes

* Quick start quide: http://www.lionet.info/asn1c/asn1c-quick.pdf
	Do check Chapter 5 for ASN.1 notation documentation.
		
* Building the libraries:
	For MacOS:
		* brew install libtool
		* brew install automake
	
	1) Unzip and cd
	2) ./configure
	3) .make 	
	4) .make check 	(Run unit tests. Should all pass.)
	
	The executable is in asn1c\asn1c

* The parser is shit.
	- It doesn't like members beginning with uppercase character.
	- It doesn't like '_' characters in members.
	
* Defining ASN.1 messages
	- Go to asn directory and create a .asn file. I created pdu_asn.asn.
		* .asn files can import other .asn files. It is recommended, though,
			to have one root .asn file to supply asn1c with.
			
* Generating code
	- Go to the directory where you wish asn1c to spit out source files. I have asn_enc_dec
	   for this example.
	   
	- ../asn1c/asn1c/asn1c ../asn/pdu_spec.asn 
	
	  This parses .asn file and generates the relevant C code.
	  * The compiler also generates one sample Makefile. Rename Makefile.sample to Makefile.
	    You will be happy to find a "regen" target in this Makefile, which is for regenerating
	    the source code from the .asn file. From now on, you can simply invoke 'make regen' to
	    get the source code, each time ASN definitions change in your.asn files.
